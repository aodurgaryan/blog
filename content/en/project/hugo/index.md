## 🧑‍🔬 Academic Website with Hugo Academic — Why You Need It and How to Build It

Creating a personal website as a researcher or student is not just a trend — it’s a key step toward professional development and building a scientific reputation. One of the best tools for this is the **Hugo** framework with the **Academic** theme (now known as [Hugo Scholar](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic)).

### ❓ Why Should a Researcher Have a Personal Website?

A personal academic site serves multiple purposes:

- 📂 **Portfolio**: publications, projects, presentations, awards — all in one place.  
- 💼 **Resume**: a modern alternative to static PDF CVs, accessible 24/7.  
- 📢 **Scientific communication**: share thoughts, blog posts, and ideas — even while your article is still in progress.  
- 🌍 **Online presence**: the site helps position yourself as a professional, attract collaborations, and get invitations.

### ⚙️ Why Choose Hugo Academic?

**Hugo Academic** is an open-source, powerful theme for the Hugo static site generator. It offers ready-to-use components for:

- ✍️ Publications (with BibTeX support)  
- 🛠 Research projects  
- 📅 Events and courses  
- 🧾 Academic resume and profile  
- 📬 Contact forms

All this comes in a modern, responsive design.

### 🛠 How to Create a Site with Hugo Academic

Here is a step-by-step guide:

1. **Install Hugo**:
   ```bash
   brew install hugo   # macOS
