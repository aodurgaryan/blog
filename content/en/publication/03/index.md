## 📄 Report Formatting — How to Structure Your Thoughts and Follow Standards

A report is not just a summary of completed work, but an official document that reflects the process, results, and conclusions of a specific task or project. Proper report formatting is essential in both academic and professional contexts — the document should be logical, coherent, and visually well-structured.

### 🧩 Structure of a Classic Report

A typical report includes the following key sections:

- **Title Page** — includes the institution or organization name, report title, author’s full name, and date.  
- **Table of Contents** — auto-generated or manually compiled, with page numbers.  
- **Introduction** — sets the goal, gives a brief overview of the task, highlights relevance, and outlines the structure.  
- **Main Body** — includes analysis, calculations, task implementation stages, methods, and technologies used.  
- **Conclusion** — summarizes the results and evaluates how well objectives were achieved.  
- **Appendices** — diagrams, tables, graphs, code listings, documentation (if applicable).  
- **References** — list of all sources cited, formatted according to GOST or another style guide.

### 📐 Basic Formatting Requirements

When preparing a report, it’s crucial to maintain a consistent style:

- **Font** — typically Times New Roman, size 12–14 pt.  
- **Line spacing** — 1.5.  
- **Indentation** — standard paragraph indent is 1.25 cm.  
- **Alignment** — body text is justified; headings are left-aligned or centered.  
- **Page numbering** — continuous, starting from the second page (title page is unnumbered).

### 🖋️ Content Tips

- Start with a **clear goal**: what you did and why.  
- Be **concise and relevant** — avoid filler text, but don’t oversimplify.  
- Define all **terms and abbreviations** when they first appear.  
- If there are charts or tables — **label and explain** them properly.  
- Use **logical transitions** between sections — this improves readability.

### 🧾 Digital vs. Printed Reports

For digital submission:

- Use PDF format — it preserves layout and formatting.  
- Check link functionality and font availability.  
- Add bookmarks (table of contents) for longer documents.

For printed submission:

- Ensure clear page margins and correct page breaks.  
- Use a black-and-white color scheme for clarity and cost-efficiency.  
- Don’t forget to **number pages** and **bind** the report as required.

Formatting is the final touch that greatly influences how your work is perceived. Even the most insightful analysis can lose impact if it’s poorly presented. So treat formatting not as a formality, but as an integral part of your professional presentation.

🧠 A well-formatted report is your calling card — it reflects your attention to detail, structured thinking, and professionalism.
