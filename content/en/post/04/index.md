## 📅 Weekly Summary — May 22  

The fourth week of the month was steady and even a bit inspiring:  

- 📑 Prepared a presentation on **"Information Systems in Management"** – it turned out concise and clear.  
- 🧩 Figured out how the **ETL process** works – now I’m eager to build something of my own.  
- 📊 Created my first **infographic on business analytics** – looks neat and easy to understand.  
- 🧘‍♀️ Attended a yoga session in the park – a great mental reset.  
- 🧠 Found a podcast about career paths in IT – listening to it on walks, lots of insights.  

Step by step, I’m getting closer to my goals!
