## ðŸ“… Weekly Summary â€” May 8  

The second week of May flew by â€” it was packed with activities, and hereâ€™s what I accomplished:  

- ðŸ“˜ Explored the core principles of **SQL queries** â€“ now SELECT, JOIN, and GROUP BY feel much easier.  
- ðŸ’¡ Conducted a mini-study on **competitive environment analysis** â€“ turned out to be really engaging.  
- ðŸ§  Watched a webinar on **financial modeling** â€“ got lots of new ideas for future projects.  
- ðŸ“¤ Submitted an essay for the **Business Informatics** course â€“ feeling proud of that.  
- ðŸŽ‰ Celebrated **Victory Day** â€“ it was heartfelt and atmospheric.  

Study, projects, and a bit of rest â€“ the formula for a great week.
