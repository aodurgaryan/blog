## 📅 Weekly Summary — May 15  

This week was intense — full of studies, deadlines, but also discoveries:  

- 📊 Learned how to work with **dashboards in Power BI** – now I can present data clearly and beautifully.  
- 📚 Read an article about **digital twins in business** – planning to use this in my coursework.  
- 📈 Tried building a **financial model for an online store** – it turned out simple but informative.  
- 🤝 Took part in a team project presentation – both interesting and valuable experience.  
- ☕️ Survived a sleepless night before a deadline – but now I can finally breathe out.  

A week of "study-work-coffee" rhythm — but it was definitely worth it.
