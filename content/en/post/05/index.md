## 📅 Weekly Summary — May 29  

The last week of May — a time to wrap up the month and finish important tasks:  

- 🧾 Submitted my **course project on digital product business analysis** – received great feedback.  
- 🔍 Conducted a comparative analysis of **ERP systems** – it really helped me understand their logic more deeply.  
- 📚 Started learning the **basic concepts of econometrics** – challenging but incredibly interesting.  
- ✍️ Updated my resume and LinkedIn profile – time to get ready for internships.  
- 🎬 Watched a motivational film about education – now I’m energized for summer!  

May was a busy month, and now it's time for new goals and opportunities!
