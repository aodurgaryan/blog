## ðŸ“… Weekly Summary â€” May 1  

The first week of May turned out to be productive and a bit hectic:  

- ðŸ“ˆ Got introduced to **business modeling** â€“ explored the Business Model Canvas framework.  
- ðŸ“Š Learned basic visualizations in **Power BI** â€“ now my reports look clear and professional.  
- ðŸ’¼ Analyzed a case on **digital transformation in a logistics company** during a seminar â€“ very engaging!  
- ðŸ“š Took detailed notes on **project management in IT**, which will come in handy later.  
- ðŸŒ¿ Participated in a community clean-up day â€“ recharged and spent time outdoors.  

A useful and dynamic week â€” letâ€™s keep up the momentum!
